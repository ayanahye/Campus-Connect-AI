Many companies ask for a resumé and cover letter when you apply for a job. A resumé describes your work experience and education. It says when you had a job and what you did. A cover letter is a short letter to the employer. You should write why you want the job and why you will be good at it. The cover letter is very important. It lets the employer know you better. It also shows how well you communicate. Find out how the company would like to receive your resumé and cover letter – by email, through a website, or printed on paper.
Go to WorkBC’s website to learn how to write your resumé and cover letter.
WorkBC Centres also offer free workshops. Visit the website to find a centre near you. 
The job search section of Canada’s Job Bank has information about writing a resumé.
References
Before you start looking for a job, find some references. References are people who know you and can recommend you for a job. Employers may contact your references to ask about your qualifications. You will need to give their names and contact information (phone number and email address) when you apply for a job. Ask former employers and landlords if they can be your reference."
International Students Resources,*** Source: https://www.welcomebc.ca/work-in-b-c/finding-work-in-b-c ****,"Criminal record checks
Some employers may ask for a criminal record check. A criminal record check is an official report from the police. It shows if you have been convicted (found guilty) of a criminal act (breaking the law). If you have a criminal record, you can still find work. However, some employers will not hire people with criminal records – for example, schools and child care companies."
International Students Resources,*** Source: https://www.welcomebc.ca/work-in-b-c/finding-work-in-b-c ****,"The employer will ask questions about your education, skills, and work experience. They might ask things like:
Why do you want to work here?
Why do you think you are the best person for the job?
Tell me about yourself.
Tell me about other jobs you’ve had.
Employers want you to explain your skills. Practise answering questions before the interview. Employers also want you to care about their business. Learn about the company before your interview. At the interview, you can also ask the employer questions. Ask about job duties, wages, work hours, benefits, and vacation time."
International Students Resources,*** Source: https://www.welcomebc.ca/work-in-b-c/finding-work-in-b-c ****,"Professional certification from a B.C. regulatory authority
Some jobs in B.C. are regulated. This means people need special education and training to do these jobs, and they need to prove that they have the required skills and training. This is called certification."
International Students Resources,*** Source: https://www.welcomebc.ca/work-in-b-c/finding-work-in-b-c ****,"Different types of credential assessments
There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

It also shows how well you communicate. Find out how the company would like to receive your resumé and cover letter – by email, through a website, or printed on paper.
Go to WorkBC’s website to learn how to write your resumé and cover letter.
WorkBC Centres also offer free workshops. Visit the website to find a centre near you.

References
Before you start looking for a job, find some references. References are people who know you and can recommend you for a job. Employers may contact your references to ask about your qualifications. You will need to give their names and contact information (phone number and email address) when you apply for a job. Ask former employers and landlords if they can be your reference."

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

Before you start looking for a job, find some references. References are people who know you and can recommend you for a job. Employers may contact your references to ask about your qualifications.

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

Many companies ask for a resumé and cover letter when you apply for a job. A resumé describes your work experience and education. It says when you had a job and what you did. A cover letter is a short letter to the employer. You should write why you want the job and why you will be good at it. The cover letter is very important. It lets the employer know you better. It also shows how well you communicate. Find out how the company would like to receive your resumé and cover letter – by email, through a website, or printed on paper.

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

If asked, employees need to provide enough information to satisfy their employer that they are ill or injured and therefore entitled to the leave. If you cannot work because you are sick, injured, or in quarantine, you can apply for Employment Insurance sickness benefits."

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

Many companies ask for a resumé and cover letter when you apply for a job. A resumé describes your work experience and education. It says when you had a job and what you did. A cover letter is a short letter to the employer. You should write why you want the job and why you will be good at it. The cover letter is very important. It lets the employer know you better. It also shows how well you communicate. Find out how the company would like to receive your resumé and cover letter – by email, through a website, or printed on paper.

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

Many companies ask for a resumé and cover letter when you apply for a job. A resumé describes your work experience and education. It says when you had a job and what you did. A cover letter is a short letter to the employer. You should write why you want the job and why you will be good at it. The cover letter is very important. It lets the employer know you better. It also shows how well you communicate. Find out how the company would like to receive your resumé and cover letter – by email, through a website, or printed on paper.
Go to WorkBC’s website to learn how to write your resumé and cover letter.
WorkBC Centres also offer free workshops. Visit the website to find a centre near you. 
The job search section of Canada’s Job Bank has information about writing a resumé.
References
Before you start looking for a job, find some references. References are people who know you and can recommend you for a job. Employers may contact your references to ask about your qualifications. You will need to give their names and contact information (phone number and email address) when you apply for a job. Ask former employers and landlords if they can be your reference."

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

If you can’t get an open work permit, you will need a job offer from an employer. In most cases, before hiring a foreign worker an employer must receive a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) showing that there are no Canadian citizens or permanent residents available to fill the job. A positive LMIA is sometimes called a confirmation letter."

Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

The pension replaces part of your income when you retire and stop working. If you qualify, you will receive monthly payments for the rest of your life.

The amount you get will depend on how much you worked. If a CPP contributor dies, their husband or wife may be eligible to get their CPP payments. These are called survivor benefits."

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

This means they are paid for the amount of work they do, not the number of hours. For example, if you work picking fruit on a farm, you may be paid for every pound of fruit you pick. If you are a writer, you may earn a certain amount of money for each word. Regardless of how you are paid, you must be paid at least the minimum wage. Some workers, such as those picking fruit or vegetables, may have different minimum wages. Ask how you will be paid before you start work."
