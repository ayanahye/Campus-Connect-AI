References
Before you start looking for a job, find some references. References are people who know you and can recommend you for a job. Employers may contact your references to ask about your qualifications.

Before you start looking for a job, find some references. References are people who know you and can recommend you for a job. Employers may contact your references to ask about your qualifications.

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

If you are not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, then you will usually need both a valid work permit and a Social Insurance Number (SIN) in order to work in British Columbia. While in B.C., you have many of the same rights as British Columbians."

If you want to come to B.C. temporarily to work, you will likely need to get a work permit.
Find out if you need a work permit
In some situations you can get a work permit even if you do not have a job offer. These work permits are called open work permits.
Find out more about open work permits
If you can’t get an open work permit, you will need a job offer from an employer. In most cases, before hiring a foreign worker an employer must receive a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) showing that there are no Canadian citizens or permanent residents available to fill the job. A positive LMIA is sometimes called a confirmation letter."

There is a fee to apply for an LMIA. The employer is responsible for applying for an LMIA and paying the application fee.

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

Applications
Most companies expect you to complete an application. You will need to give your address, phone number, work history, and references (contact information of people you worked for).

Many companies ask for a resumé and cover letter when you apply for a job. A resumé describes your work experience and education. It says when you had a job and what you did. A cover letter is a short letter to the employer. You should write why you want the job and why you will be good at it. The cover letter is very important. It lets the employer know you better. It also shows how well you communicate. Find out how the company would like to receive your resumé and cover letter – by email, through a website, or printed on paper.

References
Before you start looking for a job, find some references. References are people who know you and can recommend you for a job. Employers may contact your references to ask about your qualifications.

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

Applications
Most companies expect you to complete an application. You will need to give your address, phone number, work history, and references (contact information of people you worked for). Make sure you have all the information you need before you fill in an application form. Some companies will take your application in person. Others will only accept applications online."

Finding Work in British Columbia,*** Source: https://www.welcomebc.ca/work-in-b-c/finding-work-in-b-c ****,"Resumés
Many companies ask for a resumé and cover letter when you apply for a job. A resumé describes your work experience and education. It says when you had a job and what you did. A cover letter is a short letter to the employer. You should write why you want the job and why you will be good at it. The cover letter is very important. It lets the employer know you better. It also shows how well you communicate. Find out how the company would like to receive your resumé and cover letter – by email, through a website, or printed on paper.
Go to WorkBC’s website to learn how to write your resumé and cover letter.
WorkBC Centres also offer free workshops. Visit the website to find a centre near you. 
The job search section of Canada’s Job Bank has information about writing a resumé.
References
Before you start looking for a job, find some references. References are people who know you and can recommend you for a job. Employers may contact your references to ask about your qualifications. You will need to give their names and contact information (phone number and email address) when you apply for a job. Ask former employers and landlords if they can be your reference."

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

There are different types of credential assessment depending on what the assessment will be used for. Two common reasons that newcomers are asked to complete a credential assessment are:
Immigration - most individuals immigrating to Canada for work (economic immigration) need to have an educational credential assessment (ECA). An ECA is used to verify that a foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
Professional certification – credential assessments for professional certification often look at more than education. It may also be necessary to provide information about work experience, licenses or other official certifications from outside of Canada. In addition, it may be necessary to pass some tests related to the job.
It is very important to understand what type of assessment it is. A credential assessment that was completed for immigration purposes usually cannot be used for professional certification."

A union is a group of employees who work together to talk to the employer. Unions may ask for better wages, benefits, working conditions, and more. Unions help workers solve problems with employers.
