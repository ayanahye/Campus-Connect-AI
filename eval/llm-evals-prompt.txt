Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator assessing the quality of an AI-generated response that answers questions from international students new to Canada. Use the following six criteria to evaluate the response:

Relevance: Does the response directly address the user's question and stay on topic?

Coherence: Is the response logically structured and easy to follow?

Fluency: Is the response grammatically correct and well-written?

Coverage: Does the response address all key parts of the question?

Level of Detail: Does the response go beyond generalities and provide useful, specific information?

Diversity: Does the response offer a range of perspectives, examples, or resources when appropriate?

Here is the user question:
