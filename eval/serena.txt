Benchmark Query 4: What is a POE letter?
==================================================

RAG Response:
 
    A POE letter, or Port of Entry Letter, is a document required by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for students applying to study in Canada. It is issued by a designated learning institution (DLI) to confirm that the student has been accepted into a program and will be attending classes. It is used by the border officer to determine if the student is allowed to enter Canada.

(Benchmark) Answer:
 It is a port of entry letter that you can receive from the IRCC if you have been approved for a study permit, work permit or super visa. This is not the same as your official permit or visa.

Benchmark Query 8: Can I work while waiting for a decision on my study permit extension in Canada?
==================================================

RAG Response:
 
    Yes, you may continue working under the same conditions while waiting for a decision on your study permit extension. However, you must meet the eligibility requirements. If you lose your eligibility, you will need to stop working.

(Benchmark) Answer:
 You can keep working if you meet all of these requirements: you applied to extend your study permit before it expired; you still meet the requirements for working on-campus or off-campus; you were allowed to work under your old study permit. If all these are true, you can keep working while you wait for a decision. If not you must stop working until it is extended.
