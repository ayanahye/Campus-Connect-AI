Question,Answer
What is a POE letter?,"It is a port of entry letter that you can receive from the IRCC if you have been approved for a study permit, work permit or super visa. This is not the same as your official permit or visa."
"My university is on strike, what is going to happen to my study permit?","A strike at your university won’t affect your study permit status. You won’t be penalized for not attending classes during the strike, and you can still work off campus if your permit allows it. If your study permit is set to expire before your studies are complete, you should apply to extend it. Include a letter from your school confirming the strike prevented you from studying."
Can a lone parent apply for a study permit for a minor child?,"Yes, a lone parent can apply for a study permit for their minor child, but additional documents may be required depending on the custody situation. If you'd like more details on what specific documents might be needed based on your situation, feel free to provide more info, and I can help guide you through it! For more details, you can also check out the official IRCC page."
How long will it take to process my study permit application?,"Processing times can vary depending on the type of application you submit and where it's being processed. IRCC provides up-to-date processing times for applications submitted both inside and outside Canada. If you'd like, I can help you check the latest details, or you can visit the official IRCC processing times page for the most current information."
As an international student can I work in Canada without a work permit?,"Yes, as an international student with a study permit, you can work on campus without a work permit if you’re enrolled full-time at a designated learning institution (DLI). You can also work off-campus if your study permit allows it, for up to 24 hours a week during classes and unlimited hours during breaks. For co-ops or internships, you’ll need a specific work permit. After graduation, you may apply for a post-graduation work permit (PGWP) to work in Canada. For more details, visit IRCC’s work permit information."
I’m an international student. Can I continue to work after I’ve finished my study program?,"Generally, no. You must stop working once you’ve received your official letter of completion, transcript, or an email from your institution confirming you’ve finished your program. However, you can continue working if you applied for a work permit before your study permit expired, or if you’re starting a new study program. For more details, check out IRCC’s page on working after studies."
Can I continue to work during scheduled school breaks?,"Yes, you can work full-time during scheduled school breaks, such as summer or spring break, as long as your study permit is valid and you meet the necessary requirements. For off-campus work, make sure you meet all the requirements before you start. After the break, you can only work a maximum of 24 hours per week. If you're working on-campus, the same rules apply during scheduled breaks. For more details, check the off-campus work requirements and on-campus work requirements."
