What is a POE letter?,"It is a port of entry letter that you can receive from the IRCC if you have been approved for a study permit, work permit or super visa. This is not the same as your official permit or visa."
"My university is on strike, what is going to happen to my study permit?","A strike at your university won’t affect your study permit status. You won’t be penalized for not attending classes during the strike, and you can still work off campus if your permit allows it. If your study permit is set to expire before your studies are complete, you should apply to extend it. Include a letter from your school confirming the strike prevented you from studying."
