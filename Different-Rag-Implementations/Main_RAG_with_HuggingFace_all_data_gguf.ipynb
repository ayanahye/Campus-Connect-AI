SkyTrain - includes the Expo Line which connects downtown Vancouver, Burnaby, and Surrey, the Canada Line which connects downtown Vancouver, Richmond, and the YVR airport, and the Millenium Line which connects Downtown Vancouver with the cities of Burnaby, Coquitlam, and Port Moody. SeaBus - a passenger ferry in Vancouver, BC, that connects downtown Vancouver with North Vancouver. HandyDART - a door-to-door, shared-ride service for people with disabilities. West Coast Express - a commuter train service that operates during peak commuter hours, typically Monday to Friday. It travels between Downtown Vancouver and Mission, with multiple stations along the route. The service can run up to 5 trains a day.  These transportation options form an integrated network where passengers can transfer between different modes using the Compass Card payment system or U-Pass for students.\n",

Although it is not required, students intending to take AP courses often enrol into school based Honour Programs starting from grade 9. To apply for the Honour Program, grade 8 students will have to fill out an application form and write an exam which often takes place in January.

A credit-reporting agency will collect information whenever you take out a loan, use a credit card, or take advantage of a “buy now, pay later” offer. They will check whether or not you make your payments on time and how long it takes you to pay back money that you have borrowed. This information becomes part of what is called your credit history. Financial institutions usually check your credit history when deciding whether or not to give you a loan or credit. Landlords may use your credit history to decide whether or not they will rent to you. If your credit history is poor, a lender may refuse to give you a loan or you may have to pay a higher interest rate. In Canada, there are two credit-reporting agencies – Equifax and TransUnion.
