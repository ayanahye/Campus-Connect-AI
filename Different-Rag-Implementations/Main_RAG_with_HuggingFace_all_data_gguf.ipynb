            " Vancouver has several types of public transportation: Buses - includes regular buses, express buses (marked with 'X'), RapidBus routes (marked with 'R'), and NightBus service (routes starting with 'N'). SkyTrain - includes the Expo Line which connects downtown Vancouver, Burnaby, and Surrey, the Canada Line which connects downtown Vancouver, Richmond, and the YVR airport, and the Millenium Line which connects Downtown Vancouver with the cities of Burnaby, Coquitlam, and Port Moody. SeaBus - a passenger ferry in Vancouver, BC, that connects downtown Vancouver with North Vancouver. HandyDART - a door-to-door, shared-ride service for people with disabilities. West Coast Express - a commuter train service that operates during peak commuter hours, typically Monday to Friday. It travels between Downtown Vancouver and Mission, with multiple stations along the route. The service can run up to 5 trains a day.  These transportation options form an integrated network where passengers can transfer between different modes using the Compass Card payment system or U-Pass for students.\n",

You may also use the online tool – Trip Planner – to find the best route and timing for your trip.

Some schools are “recognized”, which means that they can grant degrees, diplomas, certificates or other qualifications. In British Columbia, there are hundreds of public and private post-secondary schools. At public universities, colleges and institutes, the government pays for most of the cost of programs, but students also have to pay some fees. Each post-secondary school and program has different fees. There are usually two main terms of study per year: September to December and January to April. Most schools also offer summer courses. Students can attend class full-time or part-time or study from home by enrolling in an online program.

Outside Metro Vancouver, you can buy these tickets and passes at many grocery stores, drugstores and convenience stores. Bus drivers do not sell tickets or passes. Children under 5 years old can ride for free when they are with an adult. Full-time students and seniors (65 years and older) may pay a lower price with valid identification.
