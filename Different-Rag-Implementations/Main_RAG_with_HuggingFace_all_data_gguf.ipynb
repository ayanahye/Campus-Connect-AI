            "        Assistant: I'm glad you asked that question. Based on the information provided, if your university is on strike and you're unable to attend classes, your study permit status should not be affected. You'll still be able to work off campus for up to 24 hours per week, and you'll remain eligible for the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program if you're graduating. However, it's important to continue having valid student status in Canada to resume your studies once the strike is resolved. If you need to extend your study permit during the strike, you should include a letter from your institution's registrar confirming the strike has prevented you from attending classes. For more detailed information, please refer to the official Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada website: <https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1367&top=15> and <https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/work-off-campus.html>.\n",
