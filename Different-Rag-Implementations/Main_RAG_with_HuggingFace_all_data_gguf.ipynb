Your family doctor will refer you to a specialist or a hospital when needed. However, you don’t need a referral from your family doctor to see a dentist or an optometrist. The Medical Services Plan (MSP) of British Columbia will pay for most expenses of your visits to family doctors. It may be hard to find a family doctor who can take you as a patient. Keep looking and talking with people. New care providers can come to community anytime. Divisions of Family Practice may know a waiting list you can join to find a doctor in your community. You can also visit the website of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia to search the Registrant Directory for doctors in your area. The waiting time can vary depending on the availability of doctors in your community. While waiting for a family doctor, you can visit a walk-in clinic if you feel sick. If you would like to have a doctor who speaks your home language, you can contact your local settlement agency; they may be able to assist you.
