Some schools are “recognized”, which means that they can grant degrees, diplomas, certificates or other qualifications. In British Columbia, there are hundreds of public and private post-secondary schools. At public universities, colleges and institutes, the government pays for most of the cost of programs, but students also have to pay some fees. Each post-secondary school and program has different fees. There are usually two main terms of study per year: September to December and January to April. Most schools also offer summer courses. Students can attend class full-time or part-time or study from home by enrolling in an online program.

You will have to use a Compass Card or Compass ticket on SkyTrains, the WestCoast Express or the SeaBus. Bus transfers are not accepted on SkyTrains or the SeaBus.

Outside Metro Vancouver, you can buy these tickets and passes at many grocery stores, drugstores and convenience stores. Bus drivers do not sell tickets or passes.

It is important to get your car ready for winter driving. To winterize your car, you need to check the battery, keep antifreeze in the radiator, use winter windshield wiper fluid, get good tires, and keep an emergency kit in your car. In some parts of the province you will need a block heater to warm up your engine before you start your car. You can talk to people at your garage, service station or dealership for advice about winter car care.
