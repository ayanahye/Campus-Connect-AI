SkyTrain - includes the Expo Line which connects downtown Vancouver, Burnaby, and Surrey, the Canada Line which connects downtown Vancouver, Richmond, and the YVR airport, and the Millenium Line which connects Downtown Vancouver with the cities of Burnaby, Coquitlam, and Port Moody. SeaBus - a passenger ferry in Vancouver, BC, that connects downtown Vancouver with North Vancouver. HandyDART - a door-to-door, shared-ride service for people with disabilities. West Coast Express - a commuter train service that operates during peak commuter hours, typically Monday to Friday. It travels between Downtown Vancouver and Mission, with multiple stations along the route. The service can run up to 5 trains a day.

If you take public transit regularly, it is cheaper to buy a pass or book of tickets. In the Metro Vancouver region, you can pay cash or use a Compass Card, and bus transfers on the bus. You will have to use a Compass Card or Compass ticket on SkyTrains, the WestCoast Express or the SeaBus. Bus transfers are not accepted on SkyTrains or the SeaBus. You can buy a Compass Card at Compass retailers, at a Compass Vending Machine, online or over the phone. Outside Metro Vancouver, you can buy these tickets and passes at many grocery stores, drugstores and convenience stores. Bus drivers do not sell tickets or passes. Children under 5 years old can ride for free when they are with an adult. Full-time students and seniors (65 years and older) may pay a lower price with valid identification.

As an international student, you'll join a diverse community with residents from over 70 countries. Living on campus provides you with a private, single-occupancy room that you can personalize to your liking. Academic benefits include higher GPAs and graduation rates compared to off-campus students. You'll have easier access to campus resources and services, which is particularly helpful when navigating a new country and university system. The residence experience promotes a sense of community and friendship, making it easier to adjust to life in Canada. You'll receive support from professional live-in staff and student support teams, and have access to 24-hour meal plans from September to April.

            "Doc: What is credit history and why is it important? A credit-reporting agency will collect information whenever you take out a loan, use a credit card, or take advantage of a “buy now, pay later” offer. They will check whether or not you make your payments on time and how long it takes you to pay back money that you have borrowed. This information becomes part of what is called your credit history. Financial institutions usually check your credit history when deciding whether or not to give you a loan or credit. Landlords may use your credit history to decide whether or not they will rent to you. If your credit history is poor, a lender may refuse to give you a loan or you may have to pay a higher interest rate. In Canada, there are two credit-reporting agencies – Equifax and TransUnion.
