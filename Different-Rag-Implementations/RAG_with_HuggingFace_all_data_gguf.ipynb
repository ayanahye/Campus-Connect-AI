            " Vancouver has several types of public transportation: Buses - includes regular buses, express buses (marked with 'X'), RapidBus routes (marked with 'R'), and NightBus service (routes starting with 'N'). SkyTrain - includes the Expo Line which connects downtown Vancouver, Burnaby, and Surrey, the Canada Line which connects downtown Vancouver, Richmond, and the YVR airport, and the Millenium Line which connects Downtown Vancouver with the cities of Burnaby, Coquitlam, and Port Moody. SeaBus - a passenger ferry in Vancouver, BC, that connects downtown Vancouver with North Vancouver. HandyDART - a door-to-door, shared-ride service for people with disabilities. West Coast Express - a commuter train service that operates during peak commuter hours, typically Monday to Friday. It travels between Downtown Vancouver and Mission, with multiple stations along the route. The service can run up to 5 trains a day.  These transportation options form an integrated network where passengers can transfer between different modes using the Compass Card payment system or U-Pass for students.\n",

Most libraries carry pocket-size pamphlets of local bus schedules and maps. In the Metro Vancouver region, you may find maps and schedules on TransLink’s website. You may also use the online tool – Trip Planner – to find the best route and timing for your trip. Outside Metro Vancouver, you can find information on BC Transit’s website. When riding on a bus, if you want the bus driver to let you off at the next stop, pull the cord above your seat or push the red button. SkyTrains, the WestCoast Express and the Seabus stop at every station along the route. In the Metro Vancouver region, you can use a Compass Card – a reloadable fare card that works on buses, SkyTrains, the WestCoast Express and the SeaBus. Outside Metro Vancouver, you need exact change in coins, or a ticket, a daypass or a monthly pass to ride the bus. You will get a transfer from the driver when you pay your fare.

A credit-reporting agency will collect information whenever you take out a loan, use a credit card, or take advantage of a “buy now, pay later” offer.

Financial institutions usually check your credit history when deciding whether or not to give you a loan or credit. Landlords may use your credit history to decide whether or not they will rent to you. If your credit history is poor, a lender may refuse to give you a loan or you may have to pay a higher interest rate. In Canada, there are two credit-reporting agencies – Equifax and TransUnion.
