They provide subsidized (government-assisted) housing, where the amount of rent you pay is based on the money you earn. To be eligible for subsidized housing, you must meet the residency requirements and have a total household income below a certain amount. They also manage the Rental Assistance Program (RAP), which provides low-income, working families with cash to help pay their monthly rent. To be eligible, families must have an annual gross household income of $40,000 or less, have assets of $100,000 or less, have at least one dependent child, have been employed at some point over the last year and have lived in B.C. for 12 months. Housing co-operatives (co-ops) and some non-profit groups also provide low-cost housing. There is often a waiting list for these places.

            "  The cost of living in British Columbia can vary greatly depending on the location. In general, the cost of housing, food, transportation, and other living expenses can be relatively high in major cities like Vancouver and Victoria. However, the cost of living in smaller towns and rural areas can be significantly lower. According to the BC Housing website, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Vancouver is around $1,800 per month. In contrast, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in a small town in the Okanagan Valley is around $400 per month. The cost of food, transportation, and other living expenses can also vary depending on the location. For example, the cost of groceries in Vancouver is around $100 per week, while in smaller towns, it's around $50 per week. The cost of transportation varies depending on the mode of transportation, with public transit being the cheapest option. For example, a monthly pass for public transit in Vancouver costs around $100, while in smaller towns, it's around $20 per month. Overall, the cost of living in British Columbia can vary greatly depending on the location.\n",
